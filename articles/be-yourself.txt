Be yourself, is all it takes!

Occasionally in life, you feel gagged and gored. As a repercussion you end up writing rancorous rants all over your blog. Once you recline, it gets reconciled into another lost cause. But unlike always for me, this time it didn't. I frisked my thoughts, rummaged around seeking answers. I listened, listened to the voices around with as much care as I could muster. The more and more I did, the system divulged. 

Its a excruciating gale-force which which makes you impetuous, portraying yourself as a young rebel. The turbulent wind is not your friend nor your enemy, but habitually you fight it, and you loose.  

The formulae for deuce is simple, its patience. The right moves at the right moment and it paves the path for you to achieve what you desired. During the quest, one of two things you want is knowledge, you fight not because you don't understand it but you very well understand how it goes and its implications. The other is focus, focus on what you want and  have the mentality to offer the world something even if it wants it or not.

Self satisfaction is something that you should earn not sit and wait for to come by and every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being. In the end, every one comprehend that you where not being a rebel, but just being yourself!
