Late as usual

<p>To be prepared is everything in life. Ever since my chat today afternoon, my mind had been flitting nimbly from one scheme to another, all to end this obfuscated egoistic act and each rendered impracticable by some annoying flaw. For an instance I debated with myself for the chance of a win but I had to go along in beliving that "fate" has an impulsive way to end things which I could never accomplish for myself, I wasted no time in bewildered inaction.</p>
<p>I moved on, Late as usual.</p>
