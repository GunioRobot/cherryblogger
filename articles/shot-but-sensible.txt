A short but sensible rant.

<p>
Exhilaration is a heady drug. But unlike other drugs it has a disadvantage that its effects seldom last for very long. For perhaps 10 minutes after the phone call, I lay back in my bed with a sort of ecstasy. I felt strong, vigorous all because of a small idea which would help us conquer the world. But as time went on, faintly first but more and more insistently I was pushed into a state of pronounced self mistrust.

To put it with less elegance, I was suffering a severe attack of cold feet. I was at the crossroads, my decisions where significant, momentous to myself. My mind deny to believe in moral excellence, in strength. I was anointed with a vacation. The secession helped me shatter the ligature of self blasphemy. I got hold of myself. I am in control. I am liberated.

If it was not for the trip, I would remain a barbarian. I thank <i>thy</i> who let me tag along.
